# ARM32-BIT CPU — RTL Design (Verilog + SystemVerilog)

---

## Project Overview
This repository contains a complete **ARM32-bit CPU** designed using **Verilog/SystemVerilog** and verified using **Vivado 2025.1** and **EDAPlayground**.  
The CPU follows a simplified educational ARM architecture (from *Harris & Harris: Digital Design and Computer Architecture — ARM Edition*), implementing:

- 32-bit datapath  
- Instruction Fetch → Decode → Execute flow  
- ARM flags (N, Z, C, V)  
- ALU operations — ADD, SUB, AND, OR  
- Conditional execution  
- Register file (R0–R15 with PC+8 behavior)  
- IMEM (instruction memory)  
- DMEM (data memory)  
- Complete CPU integration with a testbench  

All RTL modules are complete, functional, and verified.

## Module Details

### **ALU — Arithmetic Logic Unit**
- Functions: ADD, SUB, AND, OR  
- Inputs: `SrcA[31:0]`, `SrcB[31:0]`, `ALUControl[1:0]`  
- Outputs: `ALUResult[31:0]`, `ALUFlags[3:0]`  
- Flags generated:  
  - N (Negative)  
  - Z (Zero)  
  - C (Carry)  
  - V (Overflow)  
- Verified in EDAPlayground & Vivado  

---

### **Datapath**
Includes:
- Program Counter (PC)
- PC increment logic (PC → PC+4 → PC+8)
- Register File (R0–R15)
- ALU
- Immediate Extender
- MUX structures
- Write-back path

**Status:** Verified and stable.

---

### **Controller**
Contains:
- Main decoder  
- ALU decoder  
- Conditional execution logic  

Generates:
- RegWrite  
- MemWrite  
- ImmSrc  
- ALUSrc  
- FlagW  
- MemtoReg  
- PCSrc  
- RegSrc  

**Status:** Verified.

---

### **Instruction Memory (IMEM)**
- 64 × 32-bit  

- Works correctly in EDAPlayground  
- Vivado requires correct file placement (explained below)

---

### **Data Memory (DMEM)**
- 64 × 32-bit RAM  
- Write-enable controlled by `MemWrite`  
- Verified.

---

### **Top-Level CPU**
Connects:
- Datapath  
- Controller  
- IMEM  
- DMEM  

Status: Fully functional CPU simulation achieved.

## Vivado Simulation (Windows)

###  Important  
Vivado does **not** automatically detect memfile.dat.  
You must place it manually here:

```
PROJECT_NAME.srcs/sim_1/imports/memfile.dat
```
---

## Project Status

-  All RTL modules implemented  
-  Full CPU simulation successful on EDAPlayground  
-  ALU and Datapath verified on Vivado  
-  Register file, memory, decoder, controller verified  
-  Suitable for portfolio, resume, and interviews  
-  Vivado requires proper memfile.dat placement
